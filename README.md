# 🐱🐇 Cat vs Rabbit Image Classifier

This project is a **deep learning image classification app** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
It can automatically predict whether an uploaded image is a **Cat 🐱** or a **Rabbit 🐇** using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.
